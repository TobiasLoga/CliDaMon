\description{
Monthly and annual climate data are provided for specific periods
allocated to German postcode zone. The climate data can be used to calulate
the energy demand for space heating. Temperature and solar radiation during heating days
as well as degree days are provided for specific base temperatures (10°C, 12°C, and 15°C).

As a data source tables from the data package clidamonger
"Climate Data Monthly Germany" are used. The temperature and global radiation data
in clidamonger have been measured and published by "DWD - Deutscher Wetterdienst".
More information about the data sources can be found in the
IWU Excel workbook "Gradtagzahlen-Deutschland.xlsx"
Download at: https://www.iwu.de/publikationen/fachinformationen/energiebilanzen/#c205
The procedures of this package are similar to those of the Excel workbook but not identical.
